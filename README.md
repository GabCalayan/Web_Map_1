# Web Map 1
 
Introduction: 
    Welcome to my fun project I decided to make starting on May 8, 2023. Using what I learned from my course in GGR472 in UTM, I learned how to code from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a map indicating the parks/greenspaces of Toronto to bring awareness to social spaces. I am excited to show and add this into my resume for future career opportunities. 

HTML (Summary): 
    In this section, I will be explaining in brief what I did and what references I used to complete this section. I used the Mapbox API I was using in my course to create my map, with CSS Bootstrap to customize the "style" of the whole website. In this section, I have the navigation, interactivity and legend elements that are linked to my JavaScript. Basically, this HTML section is the container to place all the stuff I would input in my JavaScript Code.

JavaScript (Summary):
    This section is where I build my map from nothing into what you see right now! The sections that are included here are the map visualization part, interactive, and the legend creation. For a complete beginner, I like this part the most because it's the most satisfying once something works. 

CSS (Summary): 
    This section is where I customize the "look/style" of the whole website I created. This part includes the map stylings, img stylings and more. This code part is probably one of the most confusing I've ever done because even though the code is not too bad, it's as frustrating as adding an image onto a Word document. 

Overall, I am not done adding more parts into this website into making it look more professional. But as of right now, at least it is working! Thank you for viewing my website.
